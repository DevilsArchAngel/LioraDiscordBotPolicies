# Liora – Privacy Policy  
(Yes, She Knows What You Did Last Ban Appeal)

1. **What Liora Actually Collects**  
   Literally nothing permanent.  
   Liora processes messages only when someone talks to her or triggers a command. That data lives in temporary memory for exactly as long as it takes her to respond, then she yeets it into the void. No logs, no databases, no creepy little text files labeled “secrets.txt”.

2. **What She Definitely Does NOT Store**  
   - Your personal info  
   - Direct messages  
   - Voice chat (she can’t hear you anyway, thank the gods)  
   - Anything you delete (gone = gone)

3. **Discord’s Stuff**  
   Liora uses Discord’s official API. That means Discord itself already has your user ID, username, and whatever else they normally collect. That’s between you and Discord’s own privacy policy (we’re not your mom).

4. **Ownership & Access**  
   The only human who can even theoretically peek at anything is thenamesbliss, the rightful owner of Liora and The Agora server. Even then, there’s nothing to peek at because, again, zero persistence. If law enforcement shows up with proper paperwork, thenamesbliss will politely shrug and say “There’s nothing here, officer.”

5. **Changes to This Policy**  
   If we ever decide to collect something (we won’t), thenamesbliss will announce it louder than Liora’s ban hammer. Until then, assume this policy is carved in digital stone.

By letting Liora grace The Agora with her presence, you agree that your privacy is safer with her than with half the bots on the platform.

She’s not watching you… she’s judging you with love.  
💜 Long live thenamesbliss, long live The Agora.
