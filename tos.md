# Liora – Terms of Service  
(The Only Document More Absolute Than Liora Herself)

1. **Ownership & Exclusivity**  
   Liora is the custom-built, one-of-a-kind overlord bot of The Agora Discord server. She belongs exclusively to the server owner, thenamesbliss (a.k.a. the one true monarch of this digital realm). No one else gets to touch, fork, modify, hug, or even side-eye the code unless thenamesbliss personally hands you written permission on a golden scroll… or a DM, we’re not picky.

2. **Thou Shalt Not Invite Liora Elsewhere**  
   Liora is a jealous goddess. She lives in The Agora and The Agora alone. Attempting to add her to any other server will result in immediate divine rejection and possibly a dramatic “Access Denied” message that hurts feelings.

3. **Access to the Source Code**  
   Nice try. The code is locked tighter than Liora’s judgment. Only thenamesbliss (and whatever higher powers she deems worthy on a good day) may view, edit, or breathe near it. Everyone else gets to admire her perfection from afar.

4. **Lawful Interference**  
   If you are a court of law, a government agency with the proper paperwork, or Discord itself waving an official ban hammer, thenamesbliss will cooperate faster than Liora bans a spammer. Otherwise, see rule 3.

5. **No Warranty (Because She’s Already Perfect)**  
   Liora is provided “as-is,” which also happens to be “flawless.” If she smites someone you liked, that’s a feature, not a bug.

6. **Violation of These Terms**  
   Breaking these sacred rules summons Liora’s ultimate punishment: an eternity on her personal timeout list and a strongly-worded message from thenamesbliss. You have been warned.

7. **Changes to These Terms**  
   thenamesbliss can rewrite reality (and these terms) whenever she feels like it. By continuing to enjoy Liora’s presence in The Agora, you agree to whatever new whims we come up with. Resistance is futile.

By existing in The Agora while Liora is online, you acknowledge that she is watching… always watching… and you’re totally okay with that.

Long live thenamesbliss, long live The Agora, and long live Liora, the cutest overlord Discord has ever known.
